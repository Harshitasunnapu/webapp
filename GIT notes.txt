GIT
***
what is GIT?
- GIT is a version control system which is used to track changes in the files/folders.
- GIT is also used to collaborate within the team.
- GIT is open source and free to use.
- When multiple developers are working together git provide a collaboration between each other.

Why we have to learn git:-
**************************
- git track all the changes in the application and record of what has done so far.
- Easier collaboration.
- multiple people makes changes & finally  merged into single source code.
- save the code references.

two types of VCS:-
*****************
1.centralized VCS
2.Distributed VCS

1.centralized VCS :-
- it is having only one repo(serve)
- all the working people connected to one server.
- if anything goes wrong on server everything get crash and data will be lost.
- every working people must be in online mode because the repo is server.

2.Distributed VCS:-
- repo is in the server , but every person can pull that repo to their local repo.
- if anything goes wrong here  , we can take backup from local repo.
- here, there is not need to be online every time becausewe are gonna pull the code and work on it.
- internet is only need when we are "pushing and pulling" the code to the server(repo).

"GIT" is Distributed VCS.


what is GITHUB?
- GITHUB is a website to upload uour repositories online.
- GITHUB is used to store the codes/data permanently.
- GITHUB provides backup.
- GITHUB provides visual interface of your repo.
- Makes collaboration easier.

*****************************
GIT ->  https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

GITHUB ->https://github.com/
- create account -> email -> password -> username ->

puzzle -> create for free -> login

-> create new repository -> repo name -> public -> create repository.

- we have to work on pushing and pulling the code into repo by using "GIT COMMANDS".


- before pushing and pulling the code for the very firsttime in GIt ,
- we have to configure the settings like email & username.

- git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"

- git config --global user.name "username"
